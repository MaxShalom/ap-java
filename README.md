# Learning Java
The code and notes from the AP Computer Science course on CodeHS.
The notes are written in Markdown using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and the [code for the beginning of the course](https://github.com/MaxShalom/ap-java/tree/master/Java%20Course%20Code/Basic%20Java) is an export from the excersises from [AP Computer Science in Java](https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/apjava) on [CodeHS](https://codehs.com/) and Code for the second half of the course is from [YOF AP CS A Course](https://yofapcs.edunext.io/). Also, there are [basic examples](https://github.com/MaxShalom/ap-java/tree/master/Example%20Programs) and [resources](https://github.com/MaxShalom/ap-java/tree/master/Resources), with textbooks and practices too.

Hopes this helps anyone learning Java.
