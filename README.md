## Learning AP Computer Science A - Java

The notes are written in Markdown using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and the [code for the beginning of the course](https://github.com/MaxShalom/ap-java/tree/master/Java%20Course%20Code/Basic%20Java) is an export from the excersises from [AP Computer Science in Java](https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/apjava) on [CodeHS](https://codehs.com/). Code for the second half of the course is from the [YOF AP CS A Course](https://yofapcs.edunext.io/). I am using the [repl.it](https://repl.it/) online IDE. Also, there are [basic examples](https://github.com/MaxShalom/ap-java/tree/master/Example%20Programs) and exercises in Java. Additionally, there are also many [resources](http://maxshalom.me/ap-java/Resources/README.html), with textbooks, websites, and practices to study from. The notes are below, in the pages section.

Hopes this helps anyone learning Java.
