# Learning Java
The code and notes from the AP Computer Science course on CodeHS.
The notes are written in Markdown using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and the code is an export from the excersises from [AP Computer Science in Java](https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/apjava) on [CodeHS](https://codehs.com/) and basic examples.
Hopes this helps anyone learning Java.
