#####  Github

1. What is a README file?
   1. Describes what your code does to other viewers.
2. Moses finished working on some code for robotics, and saved his work. He opened up Github desktop and put in a descriptive summary of the changes he made, and finally committed. The next day, Moses asked Jacob to look at his code, but Jacob couldn't find any of Moses changes. What step did Moses forget to do?
   1. Push Changes
3. What is a branch and when is it appropriate to use a one?
   1. A copy of a code so you don't mess with the main code to be used when you want to merge you changes with the main code.
4. What is a pull request and when is it appropriate to use a pull request?
   1. A pull request is used when you want to merge code back into the main branch. You can use it after you finished working on a copy of the code, a branch, and after you've pushed your changes, you can submit a pull request to put both of them together.
